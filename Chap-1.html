     <P><b><big><big>F</big></big></b>ar away in a kingdom, A king named Al-Badir was present. He was well known for his bravery & was a justice in himself. He built a vast empire till his ministry betrayed him & made him blind. But, surprisingly he was engaged & had a son named Ali. After coming to notice that Al-Badir was made blind. The prince, Ali took the empire under his control. Ali was the bravest prince Basedilm could ever see. He earned the title ‘<i>Fist of God</i> ’ & ‘<i>One Armed Swordsman</i>’ as he could knockdown thousands of arrows with just a sword in hand. After he took the kingdom, Basedilm in his control he made tight security in the kingdom & decreased taxes. He took care of his father’s kingdom as like of his family & the folk too started obeying him. But, as always there is never a happy ending for prince’s & their families. A new venture of mysteries were awaiting him.</P>
    <p>
        One day when he was out for a hunt in a forest. He faced serious consequences as like if death was knocking his door. It was evening already till he had a hunt. So he decided to camp out in the forest. And went on scrolling for water, found a river nearby & decided to camp near the river. He ordered his soldiers who had been with him to set the camp and find some fire to cook the hunt & went to a tree nearer to the river to have some rest. It was night already the moon had come out; stars were twinkling in the clear sky which made the dark sky brighter. The noise of insects, wolfs & the wildies disturbing his ears. The water flowing as like if singing a merciless death song.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ali - oh, what a wonderful spot to rest out after a long tired day.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a couple of minutes when he was having rest he heard a shootout from the other side of the river. His soldiers gathered near him to guard him out. At just everything near him became silent. The noise of the wild creatures, the song of the river was, no more. The stars were disappeared behind the clouds, the sky wasn’t clear anymore. The moon’s bright shine got dim.
  </p>
  <p>
    <small><b>A DARK NIGHT FULL OF MYSTRIES AT THE RIVER ARADUS…</b></small>
   <p><small> [and from thereafter...]</small></p>

    When he observed the changes taking place near him, he felt nervous. Then he saw a shining object floating in water, coming towards him. It’s shine was so bright that it could make one blind. He felt a strange feeling as like if he was poisoned then his soldiers started jumping in the river to get the object. He shouted…
  </p>
  <p>
    Ali - nooo! Don’t! It’s too risky to swim in a fast-flowing river.
  </p>
<p>
    But, no use his soldiers didn’t respond & some of them who jumped drowned with a very loud shriek as like if something was ripping them out. The other’s didn’t stop they were hurrying to the river to catch the shining object. He dragged one of them. But, the soldier pushed him off spelling a different language. His eyeballs were collapsed & his face had turned black. Then Ali came to understand that they were hypnotized by someone or something.
</p>
<p>
    Many of them died in the river drowning with a bloody shriek & the one who remained brought the shining by passing it to one another. Whoever touched the shining object went on dying suddenly with a loud shriek. Then he felt like the shining was calling him. He heard a kind of other language in his ears. And suddenly started running towards the shining object, he tried to stop himself & had a dash with a tree, fell down. A soldier shrieking came to him & handed him the object. When he touched it he felt as if he was touching a velvet cloth. It’s shine was so bright as like if moon was being placed in his hands. Again he heard the same voice in his ears coming from the shining object.
</p>
<p>
    It said -<b><i> “Ali- eemisim, adrakul nasrul muradim Assanum.”</i></b>
</p>
<p>
    It’s brightness made him feel dizzy & he fell on the ground. In those dizzy eyes he saw a group of people covered their faces came to him.
