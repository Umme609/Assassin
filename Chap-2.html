      <p>It was early morning when Ali woke up. He had a great headache, was on a bed. Free to move in a room. He got up and tried to take a glance of where he is. When he came out the sun’s bright shine tortured his eyes so much that he fell down to ground & started shrieking loudly.</p>

      <P>Ali - <small>HELP! SOMEBODY HELP!</small></P>
      <p>
        A man 6 feet tall came to him running & moved him to the bed again. Ali had a glance with his face. He had blue eyeballs, a mustache, & white in skin colour. His hands were tough as of how a soldier’s should be. His face shape, colour, his dressing made Ali think of where he could be? Then Ali understood that he was a Nemamarian. {A group of hunters who roam covered in long hoods with special knowledge of weapons. Popularly known as Assasins.} He gave Ali a drink. He took a cloth dipped it in the mixture of turmeric powder & hot water, tied it to Ali’s eyes. He then tied the prince’s hands & legs, then said...
      </p>
      <p>
        Altair - You will feel better. But, till then stay calm okay…
      </p>

      <p>
        He took a piece of hot coal, made another drink & filtered it into the prince’s mouth. It was very hot which made him unconscious.

        </p>

        <p>
            Ali - Who are you & where am I? Why did you bring me here…
        </p>
        <p>Altair - STOP! STOP!!! You will get all your answers when you will be able to                        walk & see. Till then, you have to stay here & take rest. Okayyy</p>
        <p>Lizuki - Hey Altair, Got a Go. You are asked to come to the palace of Eden.</p>
        <p>Ali - Oh, so you are Altair.</p>
        <p>Lizuki - And I am Lizuki your highness! So, can we go now?</p>
        <p>Altair - Your highness?!!</p>
        <p>Lizuki - Didn’t you get the information? Well, he is the prince of the kingdom named Basedilm & his father is betrayed to blind. He was ruling his father’s kingdom when YOU! Altair the great! Abducted him for no reason.</p>
        <p>Altair - So, they are calling me to know why I kidnapped him.</p>
        <p>Lizuki - ...Think so.</p>
        <p>Altair - Okay then let’s go!!</p>
        <p>Ali - You can’t leave me here. I am also coming with you & stop calling me your highness. My name is Ali. Just Ali.</p>
        <p>Altair - look Ali, you need rest… (Interrupted)</p>
        <p>Ali - I think I am fine. So, I will join you.</p>
        <p>Lizuki - I think we should take him with us.</p>
        <p>Ali - Right! I am feeling really fine now.</p>
        <p>Altair – But… (Interrupted)</p>
        <p>Ali - Altair! Untie me right now. It’s an order.</p>
        <p>Altair - Ahh-haa! You aren’t bad in ordering. Haan!</p>
        <p>Scene - Altair unties Ali to get him to the palace of Eden. But, suddenly Ali attacks on Altair with a small dagger in his hands. Altair defenses the attack & hits Ali on his head to make him unconscious.</p>
        <p>Altair - How was the headshot boy! (Chuckles’)</p>
        <p>Lizuki - Ohhh Boy!! Not again.</p>
        <p>Altair - He isn’t that tough as I expected how our savior could be.</p>
        <p>Lizuki - But is sharp.</p>
        <p>Altair - Sharp! He wasn’t even able to make me a small harm.</p>
        <p>Lizuki - Really?! (Holding Altair’s hand)</p>
        <p>Lizuki - Look you have gotten a cut & you are bleeding! </p>
        <p>Altair - Ohhh. How didn’t I feel that?</p>
        <p>Lizuki - Now, let’s go!</p>
        <p>Altair - yeahhh… (Raising Ali)</p>
